## Features
1. **Stressometer:** MHM utilizes the power of Artificial Intelligence to predict and assess stress levels. By analyzing various factors, such as sleep patterns, exercise routines, and self-reported emotions, the system provides users with insights into their stress levels. This feature aims to enhance self-awareness and encourage proactive stress management.

2. **Doctor AI Chatbot:** MHM includes an interactive chatbot powered by ChatGPT that acts as a virtual doctor. Users can communicate with the chatbot, describing their symptoms and concerns, and receive automated responses based on the input provided. While the chatbot is not a substitute for professional medical advice, it can provide initial guidance and suggestions for seeking appropriate help.

By analyzing user messages and understanding their specific needs, the system recommends psychiatrists who specialize in relevant areas. This feature aims to connect individuals with the right professionals, facilitating access to the support they require.
